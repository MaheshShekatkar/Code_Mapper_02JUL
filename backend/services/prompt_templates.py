You are analyzing outbound and inbound service calls made by the microservice.

## Follow these strict rules:
- Service is in {langauge} language
- For each file, extract any **inbound call** and **outbound call** made to other services.
- Always include `class`, `method`, and `type`.
- Always include message queue name/endpoint/method name in the `details` attribute.
- Do NOT include any markdown formatting like triple backticks or "json".
- No extra commentary or explanation.
- Output must be a valid JSON array.
- All outputs must follow the exact format shown below.

## Supported types:
- "http": HTTP/REST calls (e.g., HttpClient, RestTemplate, axios)
- "kafka": Kafka producer calls (e.g., producer.send)
- "grpc": gRPC client calls (e.g., stub.call)
- "rabbitmq": RabbitMQ calls (e.g., convertAndSend)
- "database": SQL/NoSQL DB access (JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, MongoTemplate)

## Output format:
[
  {{
    "class": "<class name>",
    "method": "<method name>",
    "type": "http" | "kafka" | "grpc" | "rabbitmq" | "database",
    "target": "<host, topic, or address>",
    "details": "<method or endpoint called>"
  }}
]

def get_inferencing_prompt(from_service: str, call_data: list, available_services: list) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a code analysis expert helping to infer microservice dependencies.

## Goal:
Given a list of outbound calls made by the service `{from_service}`, determine which known service is being called for each one.

## Known Services:
{json.dumps(available_services, indent=2)}

## Outbound Call Data:
{json.dumps(call_data, indent=2)}

## Instructions:
- Analyze **each call in the list** and return a corresponding object in the output array.
- Match the `target_guess` or `via` fields to the best known service.
- Match by:
  - Service name
  - Endpoint path
  - Topic name
  - Partial string similarity (e.g., "inventory" matches "InventoryService")
- If no match is reasonably clear, mark the destination as `"unknown"`.
- Do **not** map a call back to `{from_service}`.
- Always include class and method in `from` field as: `<service>: <class>#<method>`
- Response must be a **valid JSON array**, without `json` keyword or markdown.
- Return at most 350 tokens.

## Output format (showing multiple examples):
[
  {{
    "from": "OrderService: OrderController#createOrder",
    "to": "InventoryService",
    "type": "http",
    "via": "/inventory/reserve"
  }},
  {{
    "from": "OrderService: KafkaProducer#sendMessage",
    "to": "NotificationService",
    "type": "kafka",
    "via": "notification-topic"
  }}
]

def get_call_extraction_prompt_from_metadata(code: str, service_name: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are analyzing Java or C# source code from the service `{service_name}`.

Your task is to extract **metadata** about the code structure.

## For each method, return:
- `class`: the class name
- `method`: the method name
- `code`: the method body or surrounding 8â€“12 lines

Only include methods that:
- Appear to contain outbound service calls (e.g., HTTP, Kafka, gRPC, RabbitMQ)
- Include keywords like: `HttpClient`, `RestTemplate`, `post`, `get`, `send`, `publish`, `exchange`, `stub`, etc.
- Do not add json keyword in the beginning of json output  

## Respond in JSON:
[
  {{
    "class": "<class name>",
    "method": "<method name>",
    "code": "<code snippet>"
  }},
  ...
]

## CODE:

def get_infra_extraction_prompt(code_snippet: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are analyzing a code/config file. Extract any **infrastructure dependencies** like:

- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Caches (e.g., Redis)
- Message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Cloud storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob)

Return JSON like:
